  <h2> What is Inline CSS? </h2>
  <p> Inline CSS is when you want to add an atribute to a single line. Lets say you want to make your captions blue you can do that using inline css. Making your captions blue requires a line of code that is inputted into the line of code you want. Inline CSS isn't used for your whole website rather you headline that you want to make pop.</p>

  <h2> What is Internal CSS? </h2>
  <p> Internal CSS is used when you would like one of your background to be a different color. Internal CSS is found inside the style attribute and the actual section of code will could be found in the head section. For example if you wanted a blue background and orange font to make your page stand out more Internal CSS is what you would use. All you have to do is write the code for what specifically you want colored and the color inside the class</p>

  <h2> What is External CSS? </h2>
  <p> External CSS is similar to Interanl CSS but instead its for the entire webpage. If you would like to make your entire website have a consistant color scheme this is the way to do it. To use this you would have to set up an external .css file. This file is the template to what colors you want texts to be, what font it is and even the background color. You would have to input the file into your header and then you're now using External CSS. </p>
