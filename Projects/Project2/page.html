    <h3>Exercises to Improve Self Control</h3>
    <p>1. Avoiding temptaion could be tricky but something you can do to help is thinking about snacks or foods that you are craving but end up never getting them.</p>
    <br>
    <p>2. Another exercise you could do is focusing on one goal at a time. If you have a lot of things on your plate and you think you can multitask just focus on one. That way you can focus on one thing and not be stressed about multitasking.</p>
    <br>
    <p>3. Next exercise is making sure you plan for situations that could cause for you to lose control of emotions. When you plan you can expect to be nervous or expext to be scared but when you plan you can try your best to get past it.</p>
    <br>
    <p>4. Finally is put yourself out there. In life I don't think you can get better at anything without actually doing it. So if you aren't putting yourself in situations where your emotions are challenged then you can't try to control them. So the more you feel like you can't control your emotions think of it as more expirence of trying to master self control.</p>
